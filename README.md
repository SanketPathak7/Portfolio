# [Project 1: Human Activity Recognition](https://github.com/SanketPathak7/Human-Activity-Recognition)
* Developed a Human activity Recognition model, done on data collected using Gyroscope and Accelerometer by using machine learning and deep learning techniques
* Performed Feature Engineering, data visualization and analysis on the sensor data.
* Trained multiple machine learning models including rbf SVM classifier, Random forest, Gradient Boosting
  
# [Project 2: Segmentation- Landcover](https://github.com/SanketPathak7/Multiclass-segmentation) 
* Utilized multispectral sentinel-2 satellite's imagery from landcover classfication dataset across the African continent
* Total of 1980 images were processed of 256x256 grid, classified into seven classes, example: Water, Natural vegetation, permanent snow/ice
* Achieved a jaccard index of 0.75

# [Project 3: Donors Choose](https://github.com/SanketPathak7/Donors-Choose)
* Designed experiments with multiple models to predict whether a proposal for donnation will be approved or not.
* Implemented LSTMs, Kmeans, Random Forest.
* Tried out different LSTM architectures and anlyzed their performances.
